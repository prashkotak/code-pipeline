Deep Foods is a food manufacturer based in Union Township, Union County, New Jersey that was founded in 1977 
when Gujarati delicacies made by Mrs. Bhagwati Amin became popular among her neighborhood families and local grocers. 
To meet the growing demand, in 1977, Mrs. Amin and her husband began work on what is today Deep Foods Inc. 
and specializes in frozen prepared Indian foods.[2][3] The company produces the Tandoor Chef line of frozen food products.[4][5]
